# 🌐 OpenDev Platform

**OpenDev Platform**-an open-source, cloud-native software development
platform designed to streamline the entire application lifecycle—from source
to production—using modern DevOps, GitOps, and Platform Engineering principles.

It empowers developers and operators to collaborate by providing an
integrated environment for:

- Source control
- Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Observability
- Documentation & discovery

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Unified Developer Experience**—Bring your code, pipelines, and
  environments together under one consistent interface.
- **GitOps by Default**—Declarative configuration and environment automation
  via GitOps workflows.
- **extendable Service Catalog**—Register and manage all services, APIs, and
  infrastructure components.
- **Built-in TechDocs**—Markdown-based documentation that stays versioned
  alongside code.
- **Platform-oriented Architecture**—Extend functionality through modular
  integrations (for example GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, AWS, GCP).
- **Observability Integrations**—Native support for OpenTelemetry,
  Prometheus, and Grafana.
- **Secure Multi-Tenant Design**—RBAC and SSO support using OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

## 🎯 Goals

### Open-source and community-driven

- Foster a vibrant community of contributors and users to continuously enhance
  the platform.
- Leverage open standards, open-source tools, prior art, and best practices to ensure
  interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.

### Sustainability

- Build a maintainable and scalable platform that can evolve with changing technology landscapes and organizational needs.
- Prioritize documentation, testing, and automation to reduce operational overhead.
- Leverage cloud-native technologies to optimize resource usage and cost.

### Spec-driven Development

- Maintenance of the platform should leverage agent-based spec-driven development tooling

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Devbox** for local development environment
- **Docker** ≥ 24

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/em-jones/cloud-native-platform.git
cd cloud-native-platform

# Install dependencies
# Install Devbox if not already installed (https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing-devbox/index)
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash
devbox shell

task help # List available tasks
```

Access the platform at **<http://localhost:3000>**

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is managed via environment variables and `.yaml` manifests.

Example:

```yaml
platform:
  name: OpenDev
  auth:
    provider: github
  catalog:
    sources:
      - type: github
        org: opendev-platform
  ci:
    provider: github-actions
```

---

## 🧪 CI/CD & Automation

The platform supports both **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI** out of the box.  
Pipelines are declared as YAML manifests and automatically discovered through the catalog.

Example pipeline:

```yaml
apiVersion: ci.opendev.io/v1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: build-and-deploy
spec:
  steps:
    - name: Build
      run: npm ci && npm run build
    - name: Deploy
      run: helm upgrade --install app ./charts/app
```

---

## 🔍 Observability

- Built-in metrics via **Prometheus** and **Grafana Dashboards**
- Tracing with **OpenTelemetry**
- Logging via **Loki**

---

## 🧱 Extending the Platform

You can extend OpenDev with plugins and templates.

### Example Plugin

```bash
npx create-opendev-plugin my-plugin
```

Register your plugin in `app-config.yaml` under the `plugins` section.
