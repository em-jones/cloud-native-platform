# Cloud Native Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### Repository Structure, Management, and Operations
#### Monorepo Approach
All code for the platform should be maintained in a single repository. This approach simplifies dependency management, version control, and collaboration among team members, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance across the entire platform.

#### Module Structure
Make use of ecosystem-specific standard module structures to ensure consistency and compatibility. This includes adhering to naming conventions, directory layouts, and configuration files that are widely recognized within the ecosystem.

#### Module Operations
Each module should include scripts or commands for common operations such as building, testing, and deploying.
These operations should be standardized across all modules to ensure consistency and ease of use.
In order to facilitate this, make use of the root-level `Taskfile.yaml` to define all of the operations on the basis of the activity being performed.

Primary actions should include:

- `build`: Compile or package the module.
- `test`: Run unit tests and integration tests.
- `lint`: Check code quality and style.
- `deploy`: Deploy the module to the appropriate environment.
- `clean`: Remove build artifacts and temporary files.

Secondary actions may include:

- `docs`: Generate or update documentation.
- `gen`: Generate code or configuration files as needed.

#### Documenting Modules
Each module should contain a the necessary directories and files supporting the documentation platform ADRs:
- [Documenation Platform](../../docs/adrs/0001-documentation-platform.md)
- [Documentation Quality Standard Tooling](../../docs/adrs/0002-documenation-standards-tooling.md)

#### Linting Modules
Each module should include configuration files for linting tools that enforce code quality and style standards. 
A pre-commit hook should be configured to run the linting tools before code is committed to the repository.
When adopting new linting tools, an ADR should be created to document the decision.

#### Creating Git Commits
Prior to creating a commit, ensure that all code changes have been:
- Properly linted using the configured linting tools.
- Successfully built
- Thoroughly tested, with all tests passing

Git commit messages should follow the conventions outlined in the [Git Commit Standards ADR](../../docs/adrs/0004-git-commit-standards.md). This includes using clear and descriptive commit messages that convey the purpose of the changes made.

### ADR-Driven Platform

Each newly adopted convention and every ammended convention should include an associated ADR to document the decision and rationale. 
All ADRs should be stored in either:
- The `/docs/adrs` directory of the repository.
- The `/docs/adrs` directory of the specific module, if the ADR is only relevant to that module/subsystem

### Code Standards
#### General Standards
All code should adhere to common standards that promote readability, maintainability, and performance. This includes following best practices for the specific programming languages and frameworks used within the platform.

All code should integrate with our [chosen Code Quality Tooling](../../docs/adrs/0003-code-quality-tooling.md)
#### Language-specific Style Guides and Linting tools
Each module should adhere to established style guides and utilize linting tools to maintain code quality and consistency. This includes following language-specific conventions and employing automated tools to enforce these standards during development.
### Infrastructure Guidance
#### Use Least-privilaged Access Principles

When writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) or configuring access controls, always adhere to the principle of least privilege. This means granting only the minimum necessary permissions required for a user or service to perform its function, thereby reducing potential attack surfaces and enhancing overall security.

### Rely on ADRs for Guidance about Platform Decisions



### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

**Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]
<!-- Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
